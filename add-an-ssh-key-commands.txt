Generate and set up an SSH key for github so that you don't need to always type your username and password when you push to GitHub.


Prerequisite:
git bash (or a terminal)


Commands:

1. Generate the ssh key:
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@email.com"

2. Start the ssh agent:
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s)

3. Add the ssh key to the default location:
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

4. Copy the public key to the clipboard so that we can paste it to the GitHub:
$ clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

*5. Go to GitHub - SSH and GPG keys - paste the public key from your clipboard - Add SSH key
